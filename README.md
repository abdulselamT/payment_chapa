Odoo with Chapa

This module integrates Odoo 17 with Chapa's payment gateway, enabling seamless transaction processing. To properly configure the webhook URL in your Chapa account, ensure you set it to **`/get-status-webhook-chapa`**. Additionally, when processing payments through Chapa, all required fields, such as phone numbers and email addresses, must be validated to ensure accuracy, including verifying that email addresses follow a valid format.
